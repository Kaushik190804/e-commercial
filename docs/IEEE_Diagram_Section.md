## V. SYSTEM DESIGN

### A. Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram

Figure 1 presents the ER design of E bazzar. The model includes ten entities: User (Django authentication), Product, ProductImage, Cart, CartItem, Order, OrderItem, UserAddress, Wishlist, and WishlistItem. One-to-one relations are used for per-user containers (Cart, UserAddress, Wishlist), while one-to-many relations are used for line-item entities (CartItem, OrderItem, WishlistItem, ProductImage).

### B. Data Flow Diagram (Context Level / Level 0)

Figure 2 models the complete system as a single process interacting with two external entities: Customer/User and Admin. Customer interactions include authentication, browsing, cart actions, wishlist actions, and checkout. Admin interactions include product, image, and order management.

### C. Data Flow Diagram (Level 1)

Figure 3 decomposes the system into the following processes: user authentication, product browsing, cart management, wishlist management, checkout and order processing, profile/address management, and admin operations. Data stores include Users, Products, Carts/Cart Items, Wishlists/Wishlist Items, Orders/Order Items, and User Addresses.

## Deployment Consistency Note

For production reliability, the current deployment flow runs migrations at runtime before starting Gunicorn (`python manage.py migrate && gunicorn myshop.wsgi:application`). This ensures the database schema used by the running app matches the latest code and diagrams.

## How to Export as PNG/SVG

1. Open any .mmd file in VS Code.
2. Use Mermaid preview/export support.
3. Export figures as PNG or SVG for report insertion.
4. Suggested report names:
   - Fig1_ER_Diagram
   - Fig2_DFD_Level0
   - Fig3_DFD_Level1

## Suggested Placement in Report

- Place Fig. 1 under Database Design.
- Place Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 under System Design or Functional Architecture.
- Keep figure numbering and captions consistent with IEEE formatting.
